Photonic Band Structure Computation

A new program for computing photonic band structures.

The user interface, photon-ctl, makes use of the GNU Guile interface
in order to be flexible and fully scriptable.  My libctl library is
used to automatically generate the interface code from a high-level
description (photon-ctl/photon.ctl).

The eigensolver routines are separated from the rest of the code and
are designed to be parallel from the start, using LAPACK/BLAS routines
extensively to provide portable performance.  They use block
algorithms to solve for multiple eigenvectors simultaneously, and can
easily be modified to use various iteration schemes.
