Photonic Band Structure Computation

A new program for computing photonic band structure, using the libctl
library for control files.

The eigensolver routines are separated from the rest of the code and
are designed to be parallel from the start, using LAPACK/BLAS routines
extensively to provide portable performance.  They use block
algorithms to solve for multiple eigenvectors simultaneously, and can
easily be modified to use various iteration schemes.
