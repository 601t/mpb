Profile--where is the performance going?  Systematic comparisons with old code.

Add ability to solve for only even/odd bands w.r.t. z=0 plane.

Optimize multiplications by diagonal matrices?

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Store epsilon differently?

implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions)

World domination.
