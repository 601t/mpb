Support for parallel transform with MPI.

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Export/import DXF, VRML, POV, ...?

Add ability to solve for only even/odd bands w.r.t. z=0 plane.

Used enhanced analytic trace minimization algorithm to minimized in a
p-dimensional space at each step, instead of a 1-dimensional space.

More profiling to find performance bottlenecks.  More systematic
comparisons with our old code.

Optimize multiplications by diagonal matrices?

Store epsilon differently?

Implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions to clean things up a bit).

World domination.
