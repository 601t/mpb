Improved mesh: icosohedron vertices for determining normal, and 3^3 mesh
for averaging?

Recursive geometry inclusion testing to find material_of_point in log time.

Finish tuning maxwell preconditioner.  Implement fancy preconditioner.

Profile--where is the performance going?

Optimize multiplications by diagonal matrices?

Use new LAPACK 3.0 eigensolver routines.

Check which order to link in -lblas and -ldgemm.

Fix linking with -lessl on AIX...what is going on there?

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Store epsilon differently?

implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions)

World domination.
