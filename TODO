Support for parallel transform with MPI.  Support other types of
parallelization (e.g. doing different k points in parallel) without
requiring external scripts.

Export/import DXF, VRML, POV, ...?

More eigensolver improvements...adaptive selection of an iteration technique?

Try Jacobi-Davidson method with harmonic eigenvalues for targeted solver.

Support Hermitian (complex) dielectric tensors for magneto-optical materials.

More profiling to find performance bottlenecks.  More systematic
comparisons with our old code.

Store epsilon differently?

World domination.
