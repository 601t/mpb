Different convergence test, like in old code: eigenvalue converged
*and* |grad|/|y| small.  In old code, tolerance in eigenval is
specified in cntrl file, and tolerance in residual (gradient) defaults
to 1 (is number after tolerance in cntrl file, which is normally
omitted).  (What is |grad|/|y|?  Units don't make sense.)

Profile--where is the performance going?  Systematic comparisons with old code.

Add ability to solve for only even/odd bands w.r.t. z=0 plane.

Optimize multiplications by diagonal matrices?

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Add HDF4 support (uniprocessor only)?

Export/import DXF, VRML, POV, ...?

Store epsilon differently?

implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions)

World domination.
