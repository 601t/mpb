Finish tuning maxwell preconditioner.

Profile--where is the performance going?

Optimize multiplications by diagonal matrices?

Check which order to link in -lblas and -ldgemm.

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Store epsilon differently?

Output fields to HDF.  (Eventually, use HDF5...?)

Interface with libctl for input and control.

implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions)

in update_k_vector, check for k == 0 (or any integer multiple of G)

World domination.
