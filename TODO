Support for parallel transform with MPI.

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Export/import DXF, VRML, POV, ...?

More eigensolver improvements...adaptive selection of an iteration technique.

Support Hermitian (complex) dielectric tensors for magneto-optical materials.

More profiling to find performance bottlenecks.  More systematic
comparisons with our old code.

Store epsilon differently?

Implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions to clean things up a bit).

World domination.
