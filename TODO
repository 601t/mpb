Fix convergence bug when running e.g. tst2.ctl!!!  [ fixed? ]

dimensions < true_rank should make grid sizes 1 in extra dimensions.

Prevent sumte/sumtm/sumfrq header lines from being output when not
needed (put in solve-kpoint, when called with kpoint_index == 0,
instead of in init_params).

Add "filename-prefix" input variable for adding a prefix to all output
filenames.

Prepend "k" and "b" to k-point and band indices in output filenames.

Start band indices with one.

Finish tuning maxwell preconditioner.  Implement fancy preconditioner.

Profile--where is the performance going?

Optimize multiplications by diagonal matrices?

Check which order to link in -lblas and -ldgemm.

Fix linking with -lessl on AIX...what is going on there?

Allow real-complex transforms for structures with inversion symmetry.

Store epsilon differently?

Output fields to HDF.  (HDF5?)

implement create_evectmatrix_clone, evectmatrices_conformant_p
(convenience functions)

World domination.
