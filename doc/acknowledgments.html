<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>Steven G. Johnson was supported in part by the Materials Research
Science and Engineering Center program of the National Science
Foundation under Grant No. DMR-9400334, a National Defense Science and
Engineering Fellowship, and an MIT Karl Taylor Compton Fellowship.

<p>We would also like to thank the MIT Center for Materials Science
and Engineering, which donated a pair of 4-processor Pentium II
machines that served as the primary platform for the development of
the Photonic-Bands package.  We thank the Linux community for
providing a decent OS to run on that machine.

<p>This project is also deeply indebted to the free software community
for many invaluable tools and libraries, especially the GNU project
(for Guile, gcc, autoconf, as well as its courage and leadership), the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of
Illinois (for HDF), and the LAPACK/BLAS developers.

<p>I thank Dr. Matteo Frigo for his friendship, inspiration, and
definition of "legacy code" as "any program written by a physicist."
Dr. Shanhui Fan and Dr. Pierre R. Villeneuve endured endless
interruptions by their group-mate and were generous with their
patience and encouragement.  Thanks to Dr. Douglas C. Allan of Corning
for pestering (and bribing) me to bring the program to a usable state.

<p>This project would not exist without the tireless guidance,
support, and encouragement of Prof. J. D. Joannopoulos of MIT.  Thanks
for letting me do things my way, John!
