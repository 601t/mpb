<p>As a clarification, we should note that Scheme control
(<code>ctl</code>) files, written by the user (i.e. not containing
code distributed with MIT Photonic-Bands) and loaded at runtime by the
MIT Photonic-Bands software, are <em>not</em> considered derived works
of MIT Photonic-Bands and do <em>not</em> fall thereby under the

<p>In addition, all of the example Scheme code in this manual, as well
as the example ctl files in the <code>mpb-ctl/examples/</code>
directory, may be freely used, modified, and redistributed, without
any restrictions.  (The warranty disclaimer still applies, of course.)

(You are not legally <em>required</em> to do so; it is up to your
common sense to decide whether you want to comply with this request or
