<h2><a name="referencing">Referencing</a></h2>

<p>We kindly ask you to reference the MIT Photonic-Bands package and
its authors in any publication for which you used MPB.  (You are not
legally <em>required</em> to do so; it is up to your common sense to
decide whether you want to comply with this request or not.)  The
preferred citation is our paper on MPB and related topics:

<blockquote>
Steven G. Johnson and J. D. Joannopoulos, "<a href="http://www.opticsexpress.org/oearchive/source/27937.htm">Block-iterative
frequency-domain methods for Maxwell's equations in a planewave
basis</a>," <i>Optics Express</i> <b>8</b>, no. 3, 173-190 (2001).
</blockquote>

<p>If, in addition, you wish to reference the web site (although this
is referenced by the above paper), we suggest something like:

<blockquote>
Steven G. Johnson and J. D. Joannopoulos, <i>The MIT Photonic-Bands
Package</i>, <code>http://ab-initio.mit.edu/mpb/</code>.
</blockquote>

<p>If you want a "one-line" description of the algorithm
for inclusion in a publication, we recommend:

<blockquote>
Fully-vectorial eigenmodes of Maxwell's equations with periodic
boundary conditions were computed by preconditioned conjugate-gradient
minimization of the block Rayleigh quotient in a planewave basis,
using a freely available software package [<i>ref</i>].
