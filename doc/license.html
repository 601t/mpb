<p>We kindly ask you to reference the MIT Photonic-Bands package and
its authors in any publication for which you used MPB.  (You are not
legally <em>required</em> to do so; it is up to your common sense to
decide whether you want to comply with this request or not.)  The
preferred citation is our paper on MPB and related topics:

<blockquote>

frequency-domain methods for Maxwell's equations in a planewave

<p>Or, in <a href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jacobsd/bib/formats/bibtex.html">BibTeX</a> format:

<pre>
@Article{Johnson2001:mpb,
  author =       {Johnson, Steven~G. and Joannopoulos, J.~D.},
  title =        {Block-iterative frequency-domain methods for Maxwell's equations in a planewave basis},
  journal =      {Opt. Express},
  year =         2001,

<p>If you want a one-sentence description of the algorithm
for inclusion in a publication, we recommend:

<blockquote>
Fully-vectorial eigenmodes of Maxwell's equations with periodic
boundary conditions were computed by preconditioned conjugate-gradient
minimization of the block Rayleigh quotient in a planewave basis,
using a freely available software package [<i>ref</i>].
