<h1 align=center>MIT Photonic-Bands</h1>

<p>Welcome to the manual for the <a
href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/mpb/" title="MIT Photonic-Bands Home
Page">MIT Photonic-Bands</a> (MPB) package, a program for computing
band structures (dispersion relations) of optical systems.
Photonic-Bands was developed by Steven G. Johnson of the Joannopoulos
<a href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/">Ab Initio Physics Group</a> in the
Condensed Matter Theory division of the <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/org/p/physics/www/physics.html">MIT
Physics Department</a>.

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>This documentation is divided into the following sections:

<ul>

<li><a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a>:

The introductory section describes the motivation, history, and
high-level structure of this package.

<p><li><a href="installation.html">Installation</a>:

How to install and compile Photonic-Bands, including descriptions
of and links to software you must first download and install from
other sources.

<p><li><a href="user-tutorial.html">User Tutorial</a>:

In this section, we introduce the use of Photonic-Bands to compute a
photonic band structure.  A simple tutorial illustrates how the basic
features are used to solve for the modes of example structures.

<p><li><a href="analysis-tutorial.html">Data Analysis Tutorial</a>:

Here, we walk through how you might analyze and visualize the results
from a couple of typical MPB calculations.  Includes some pretty
pictures for those who don't like to read.

<p><li><a href="user-ref.html">User Reference</a>:

A compact listing of the various functions and features provided by
the user interface.

<p><li><a href="developer.html">Developer Information</a>:

In this section, we outline some of the internal structure and
algorithms used in Photonic-Bands, as an aid to outside developers
wishing to add new features and bugs.

<p><li><a href="acknowledgments.html">Acknowledgments</a>:

A project of this size could never be completed without the support
of many others, to whom we are very grateful.

<p><li><a href="license.html">License and Copyright</a>:
