<h1 align=center>Photonic-Bands</h1>

<p>Welcome to the manual for the <b>Photonic-Bands</b> package, a
program for computing band structures (dispersion relations) of
optical systems.  This documentation is divided into the following
sections:

<h2><a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The introductory section describes the motivation, history, and
high-level structure of this package.

<h2><a href="installation.html">Installation</a></h2>

<p>How to install and compile Photonic-Bands, including descriptions
of and links to software you must first download and install from
other sources.

<h2><a href="user-tutorial.html">User Tutorial</a></h2>

<p>In this section, we introduce the use of Photonic-Bands to compute
a photonic band structure.  A simple tutorial illustrates how the
basic features are used to solve for the modes of an example
structure.

<h2><a href="user-ref.html">User Reference</a></h2>

A compact listing of the various functions and features provided by
the user interface.

<h2><a href="developer.html">Developer Information</a></h2>

In this section, we outline some of the internal structure and
algorithms used in Photonic-Bands, as an aid to outside developers
wishing to add new features and bugs.

<h2><a href="acknowledgments.html">Acknowledgments</a></h2>

<p>A project of this size could never be completed without the support
of many others, to whom we are very grateful.

<h2><a href="license.html">License and Copyright</a></h2>
