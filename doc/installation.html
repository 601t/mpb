<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>In this section, we outline the procedure for installing the
Photonic-Bands package.  Mainly, this consists of downloading and
installing various prerequisites.  As much as possible, we have
attempted to take advantage of existing packages such as BLAS, LAPACK,
FFTW, and GNU Guile, in order to make our code smaller, more robust,
faster, and more flexible.  Unfortunately, this may make the
installation of Photonic-Bands more complicated if you do not already
have these packages.

<p>You will also need an ANSI C compiler, of course (gcc is fine), and
installation will be easiest on a UNIX-like system (Linux is fine).

<h2>BLAS</h2>

<p>The first thing you must have on your system is a BLAS
implementation.  "BLAS" stands for "Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines,"
and is a standard interface for operations like matrix multiplication.
It is designed as a building-block for other linear-algebra
applications, and is used both directly by our code and in LAPACK (see
below).  By using it, we can take advantage of many highly-optimized
implementations of these operations that have been written to the BLAS
interface.  (Note that you will need implementations of BLAS levels 1-3.)

<p>You can find more BLAS information, as well as a basic
implementation, on the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS
Homepage</a>.  It is a good idea to try and find a more optimized BLAS
code for your hardware, though.  Vendor-optimized BLAS implementations
are available as part of the Compaq CXML, IBM ESSL, SGI sgimath, and
other libraries.  Recently, there has also been work on
self-optimizing BLAS implementations that can achieve performance
competitive with vendor-tuned codes; see the <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~siyer/">PhiPACK</a> and <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/atlas/">ATLAS</a> homepages (these only
implement some BLAS operations, however, so you will still need a
generic BLAS).  Links to more BLAS implementations can be found on <a
href="http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/B/0/BLAS.html" title="Scientific
Applications on Linux (SAL) BLAS page">SAL</a>.

<h2>LAPACK</h2>

<p>LAPACK, the Linear Algebra PACKage, is a standard collection of
routines, built on BLAS, for more-complicated (dense) linear algebra
operations like matrix inversion and diagonalization.  You can
download LAPACK from the <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK Home Page</a>.  More
LAPACK links can be found on <a
href="http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/B/0/LAPACK.html" title="Scientific
Applications on Linux (SAL) LAPACK page">SAL</a>.

<h2>HDF5</h2>

<p>We require a portable, standard binary format for outputting the
electromagnetic fields and similar volumetric data, and for this we
use HDF.  HDF is a widely-used, free, portable library and file format
for multi-dimensional scientific data, developed in the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of
Illinois (UIUC, home of the <a
href="http://www.fightingillini.com/">Fighting Illini</a> and <i>alma
mater</i> of many of my fine relatives).

<p>There are two incompatible versions of HDF, HDF4 and HDF5 (no, not
HDF1 and HDF2).  We require the newer version, HDF5.  (We use the
newer version because it will be the focus of future development, it
is cleaner, and it supports parallel I/O via MPI.)  Many visualization
and data-analysis tools still use HDF4, but HDF5 includes an
<code>h5toh4</code> conversion program that you can use if you need
HDF4 files.

<p>You can get HDF and learn about it on the <a
href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu">HDF Home Page</a>.

<h2>MPI</h2>

<p>Optionally, Photonic-Bands can run on a distributed-memory parallel
machine, and to do this we use the standard MPI message-passing
interface.  You can download and learn about MPI from the <a
href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/index.html">MPI Home Page</a>.
Most commercial supercomputers already have an MPI implementation
installed.

<p>MPI is <i>not required</i> to compile the ordinary, uniprocessor
version of Photonic-Bands.  In fact, our MPI code is not even fully
implemented yet; thank you for your patience (we value your call).

<h2>FFTW</h2>

<p>FFTW is a self-optimizing, portable, high-performance FFT
implementation, including both serial and parallel FFTs.  You can
download FFTW and find out more about it from the <a
href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW Home Page</a>.  If you want to use
Photonic-Bands on a parallel machine with MPI, you will also need to
install the <a href="">MPI FFTW</a> libraries (this just means
including <code>--enable-mpi</mpi> in the FFTW <code>configure</code>
flags).

<h2>GNU Guile</h2>

GNU Guile is an extension/scripting language implementation based on
Scheme, and we use it to provide a rich, fully-programmable
user-interface with minimal effort.  It's free, of course, and you can
download it from the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile Home
Page</a>.

<h2>libctl</h2>

Instead of using Guile directly, we separated much of the user
interface code into a package called libctl, in the hope that this
might be more generally useful.  libctl automatically handles the
communication between the program and Guile, converting complicated
data structures and so on, to make it even easier to use Guile to
control scientific applications.  Download libctl from the <a
href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/libctl/">libctl home site</a>, unpack
it, and run the included <code>configure</code> script.  You'll also
want to browse its <a
href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/libctl/doc/">manual</a>, as this will
give you a general overview of what the user interface will be like.

<p>Currently, the <code>libctl/</code> and <code>photonic-bands/</code>
directories (the latter being the Photonic-Bands package), must both
reside within the same parent directory.

<h2>GNU Autoconf</h2>

<p>If you want to be a developer of the Photonic-Bands package (as
opposed to a user), you will also need the GNU Autoconf program.
Autoconf is a portability tool that generates <code>configure</code>
scripts to automatically detect the capabilities of a system and
configure a package accordingly.  You can find out more at the <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/autoconf/">Autoconf Home Page</a>
(autoconf is typically installed by default on Linux systems).

<h2>Photonic-Bands</h2>

<p>Okay, if you've made it all the way here, you're ready to install
the Photonic-Bands package and start cranking out eigenmodes.  (You
can download the latest version and read this manual at the <a
href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/photonic-bands/">Photonic-Bands
Homepage</a>.)  Once you've unpacked it, just run:

<pre>
./configure
make
</pre>

<p>to configure and compile the package.  Hopefully, the
<code>configure</code> script will correctly detect the BLAS, FFTW,
etcetera libraries that you've dutifully installed, as well as the C
compiler and so on, and the <code>make</code> compilation will proceed
without a hitch.  If not, it's a <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/SMOP.html">Simple
Matter of Programming</a> to correct the problem.
<code>configure</code> accepts several flags that we hope will work
someday, such as <code>--enable-mpi</code> to turn on MPI support, as
well as a number of standard flags that work already
(<code>./configure --help</code> for more info).

<p>Once compiled, the main program (as opposed to various test
programs) resides in the <code>photon-ctl/</code> subdirectory, and is
called <code>photon</code>.
