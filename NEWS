  * Added run-even and run-odd functions, so you can now compute only
    even/odd states (with respect to a z=0 mirror plane) in systems with
    sufficient symmetry.  See also the new z-parity output variable.

  * Added epsilon-input-file variable, so that you can now read the
    dielectric function from a file.

  * configure should work even when there is no Fortran compiler on your
    system (assuming your BLAS, etc., libraries work without Fortran libs).
    Thanks to Antti Renko for the bug report.

  * Fixed problems detecting BLAS and LAPACK shared libraries in configure.
    Thanks to Karri Varris for the bug report.

  * Fixed trailing spaces in sed command, which were breaking 'make install'
    on some systems.  (Thanks to Ron Chase for the bug report.)

MPB 0.80.1 (11/22/1999)

  * Added output-hfield-x, output-dfield-y, etcetera, functions for
    outputting only specific field components (see manual reference section).

  * Sped up HDF5 field output routines.

  * Added output-copies variable to set the number of periods output by
    the band output functions (see manual reference section).

MPB 0.80 (11/19/1999)

  * Initial public release.
