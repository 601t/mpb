  * Added support for a new material type, dielectric-anisotropic, so
    that you can specify arbitrary real/symmetric dielectric tensors.

  * When outputting fields, output all field components (x, y, z, and
    real and imaginary parts) to a single HDF5 file.  Also include info
    on the lattice and k-point vectors to facilitate post-processing.

  * Use CPPFLAGS environment variable instead of the less-standard
    INCLUDES to pass -I flags to the configure script (for header files
    in non-standard locations).

  * Fixed z-parity output and run-even/odd functions for 2d grids.

  * Fixed bug in output-dpwr-in-objects.  Thanks to Mihai Ibanescu for
    the bug report.

  * Compilation fixes.  We need to set SHELL in the Makefile for make on
    some systems.  Also added rule to insure ctl-io.h is created before
    main.c is compiled.  Thanks to Christoph Becher for the bug reports.

MPB 0.9.1 (1/7/2000)

  * Fixed eigensolver bug where special handling of Gamma (k=0) point could
    screw up convergence for subsequent k-points, causing incorrect results.

  * Fixed behavior of filename-prefix input variable; thanks to Karl Koch
    for the bug report.

MPB 0.9 (1/2/2000)

  * Added run-even and run-odd functions, so you can now compute only
    even/odd states (with respect to a z=0 mirror plane) in systems with
    sufficient symmetry.  See also the new z-parity output variable.

  * Added epsilon-input-file variable, so that you can now read an
    arbitrary dielectric function from a file.

  * Field file names now include the polarization (e.g. ".tm").

  * Some optimizations in the eigensolver.

  * Some documentation improvements; thanks to Edmond Chow for his comments.

  * configure should work even when there is no Fortran compiler on your
    system (assuming your BLAS, etc., libraries work without Fortran libs).
    Thanks to Antti Renko for the bug report.

  * Fixed problems detecting BLAS and LAPACK shared libraries in configure.
    Thanks to Karri Varris for the bug report.

  * Fixed trailing spaces in sed command, which were breaking 'make install'
    on some systems.  Thanks to Ron Chase for the bug report.

MPB 0.8.1 (11/22/1999)

  * Added output-hfield-x, output-dfield-y, etcetera, functions for
    outputting only specific field components (see manual reference section).

  * Sped up HDF5 field output routines.

  * Added output-copies variable to set the number of periods output by
    the band output functions (see manual reference section).

MPB 0.8 (11/19/1999)

  * Initial public release.
