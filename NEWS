  * Can now take advantage of inversion symmetry in the geometry, gaining
    at least a factor of two in speed and a factor of two in memory.
    To use this, you configure MPB with --with-inv-symmetry; the resulting
    executable is installed as "mpbi" and only supports inversion symmetry,
    so you will usually want to install the ordinary MPB as well.

  * Added new eigensolver-block-size input variable, so that MPB can
    optionally solve for only a few bands at a time instead of all
    at once, reducing memory requirements and often increasing speed.

  * Improved handling of the singular (zero-frequency) solutions at
    the Gamma (k=0) point.  This k point should no longer converge
    slowly (or cause additional problems in the targeted eigensolver).

  * You can now pass a "thunk" (function of no arguments) to run, and
    it will be evaluated once per k-point (instead of once per band
    per k-point as for ordinary band functions).

  * compute-field-energy function now also returns the fraction of the
    energy in the various field components.

  * Added first-brillouin-zone function to transform an arbitrary
    k-point into an equivalent point in the first Brillouin zone.
    Thanks to Payam Rabiei for the suggestion.

  * In mpb-data, the center of the output cell is now always identical
    to the origin of the coordinate system.  Thanks to Michelle
    Povinelli for pointing out this deficiency.	

  * Used improved spherical-quadrature formula in computing the
    effective dielectric tensor in 3d; this should increase accuracy
    somewhat at lower grid resolutions.

MPB 0.12 (7/9/2000)

  * Added fix-*field-phase functions to allow a deterministic phase
    in the output fields, thanks to a suggestion by Doug Allan.

  * Added group-velocity calculation functions (display-group-velocities,
    etcetera).

  * Added -e x,y,z option to mpb-data so that you can now specify
    an orientation of the output cell (e.g. to make the first axis
    the 111 direction of an fcc crystal).

  * Added (index n) substitute for epsilon property of dielectrics,
    equivalent to (epsilon (* n n)).

  * Documented new libgeom features: cone geometric object, coordinate
    conversion functions (reciprocal->lattice, lattice->cartesian, etc.),
    and vector/matrix rotation.

  * compute-field-energy now returns the total, unnormalized energy
    in the corresponding field; combined with compute-energy-in-objects,
    this makes it easy to do some perturbation theory and related
    calculations.

  * Eigensolver improvements.  Periodic reorthogonalization and
    renormalization to combat some numerical problems. New 
    line-minimization code, included with permission from MINPACK-2
    by Jorge More.

  * Fixed breaking of 90-degree rotational symmetry-breaking by the mesh
    in 2d; thanks to Jim West and Doug Allan of Corning for the bug
    report.  (In general, some symmetry-breaking by the discretization
    seems hard to avoid, however.)

  * Fixed bug in field output routines that could cause crashes
    for grid sizes not a multiple of 4.

  * Bug fix in dielectric function construction for 2d systems: we
    now use the xy plane at z=0 as documented, instead of z=-0.5.

MPB 0.11 (2/12/2000)

  * configure script can now detect and link ATLAS 3.0 accelerated BLAS.

  * Added band-range-data output variable.

  * Running mpb-data multiple times on the same file now replaces
    the results of the previous run, instead of appending -new2,
    -new3, etcetera.

  * Fixed bug in run-even/run-odd that could seriously slow or even
    prevent eigensolver convergence.  Thanks to Payam Rabiei for the
    bug report.

  * Fixed compilation --without-hdf5, or when HDF5 is not found.  Thanks
    to Rajesh Rengarajan for the bug report.

MPB 0.10 (1/28/2000)

  * Added mpb-data utility for post-processing data (e.g. for unskewing
    non-orthogonal lattices).  See the data analysis tutorial or
    man mpb-data for more information.

  * Added new data analysis tutorial to the manual, describing how to
    analyze and visualize the results of two sample calculations.

  * Added support for a new material type, dielectric-anisotropic, so
    that you can specify arbitrary real/symmetric dielectric tensors.

  * Added new output-at-kpoint function to make it easier to output
    fields only at a single k-point in a band-structure calculation.

  * When outputting fields, output all field components (x, y, z, and
    real and imaginary parts) to a single HDF5 file.  Also include info
    on the lattice and k-point vectors to facilitate post-processing.

  * Added new subsection to the installation manual describing some
    generic installation path issues on Unix that were confusing people.

  * Use CPPFLAGS environment variable instead of the less-standard
    INCLUDES to pass -I flags to the configure script (for header files
    in non-standard locations).

  * Added diamond.ctl example file for a 3d diamond (fcc) lattice of spheres.

  * Added (brief) mpb man page.

  * Fixed z-parity output and run-even/odd functions for 2d grids.

  * Fixed bug in output-dpwr-in-objects.  Thanks to Mihai Ibanescu for
    the bug report.

  * Compilation fixes.  We need to set SHELL in the Makefile for make on
    some systems.  Also added rule to insure ctl-io.h is created before
    main.c is compiled.  Thanks to Christoph Becher for the bug reports.

MPB 0.9.1 (1/7/2000)

  * Fixed eigensolver bug where special handling of Gamma (k=0) point could
    screw up convergence for subsequent k-points, causing incorrect results.

  * Fixed behavior of filename-prefix input variable; thanks to Karl Koch
    for the bug report.

MPB 0.9 (1/2/2000)

  * Added run-even and run-odd functions, so you can now compute only
    even/odd states (with respect to a z=0 mirror plane) in systems with
    sufficient symmetry.  See also the new z-parity output variable.

  * Added epsilon-input-file variable, so that you can now read an
    arbitrary dielectric function from a file.

  * Field file names now include the polarization (e.g. ".tm").

  * Some optimizations in the eigensolver.

  * Some documentation improvements; thanks to Edmond Chow for his comments.

  * configure should work even when there is no Fortran compiler on your
    system (assuming your BLAS, etc., libraries work without Fortran libs).
    Thanks to Antti Renko for the bug report.

  * Fixed problems detecting BLAS and LAPACK shared libraries in configure.
    Thanks to Karri Varris for the bug report.

  * Fixed trailing spaces in sed command, which were breaking 'make install'
    on some systems.  Thanks to Ron Chase for the bug report.

MPB 0.8.1 (11/22/1999)

  * Added output-hfield-x, output-dfield-y, etcetera, functions for
    outputting only specific field components (see manual reference section).

  * Sped up HDF5 field output routines.

  * Added output-copies variable to set the number of periods output by
    the band output functions (see manual reference section).

MPB 0.8 (11/19/1999)

  * Initial public release.
